# Morning Brief Rules (from Patrik) — 2026-02-24

## Format goals
1. Top 3 OpenClaw use-cases must be innovative and outside-the-box.
2. App section should present 3 candidate app ideas and ask Patrik to choose 1.
3. Chosen idea should immediately become active work (start now or add to todo).

## App idea quality bar
- Innovative/novel angle
- Directly tied to a real practical or psychological user need
- Include both categories over time:
  - Functional Android apps
  - Android games
- Publish target: Play Store

## Design approval gate (always-on)
- For every new app concept or major feature, present visual design proposals before build lock.
- Minimum output each time:
  1) 2–3 UI design directions (screens/mockups)
  2) short rationale per direction
  3) explicit approve/reject question to Patrik
- No final UI direction is treated as locked before Patrik approval.

## Current focus lock
- Primary: AI Study Coach
- Deadline: Friday 18:00 (Europe/Stockholm)
- Today: full gamification focus until 18:00
- Checkpoints: every 90 minutes
- Keep "all-in-one assistant" idea parked for later
