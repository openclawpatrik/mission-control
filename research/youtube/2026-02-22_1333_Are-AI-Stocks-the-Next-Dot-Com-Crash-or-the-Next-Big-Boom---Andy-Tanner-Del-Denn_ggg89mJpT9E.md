## FitzWorks Analysis
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a short Swedish report with specific sections. First, I need to understand the content of the video transcript provided. The main points are about AI stocks potentially being a bubble similar to the dot-com era, but with differences. The speaker, Andy Tanner, discusses the current AI boom, mentions the Levi Strauss analogy (selling tools rather than the gold), and talks about energy constraints and nuclear power as potential solutions. He's bullish on AI's long-term impact but cautious about job displacement and market bubbles.

Now, the user wants a report in Swedish with exact sections. Let me break down each section:

1) TLDR: Summarize the video in 3 sentences. Need to capture the main idea that AI is a boom with potential bubbles, compare to dot-com, and mention the focus on infrastructure and energy.

2) Viktiga idéer: Max 5 bullets. Key points from the video: AI is a boom with real infrastructure needs, energy constraints, potential for nuclear power, focus on tools (like data centers) rather than just the tech, and the shift from labor to automation affecting jobs.

3) Applicering i FitzWorks: 5 concrete actions. Maybe invest in AI infrastructure (data centers, energy solutions), monitor energy-related stocks, focus on companies that provide tools (like software for AI), consider nuclear energy investments, and prepare for job market changes by upskilling.

4) Vad vi INTE ska göra: 3 risks. Avoid overinvesting in speculative AI stocks, don't ignore energy constraints, and avoid underestimating job displacement impacts.

5) Applicerbar nu? JA/NEJ with reason. JA because the infrastructure and energy aspects are tangible and actionable now.

6) Rekommenderat nästa steg: One action today. Maybe research energy solutions or AI infrastructure companies.

Need to make sure all sections are in Swedish, concise, and follow the structure. Check for any missed points from the transcript and ensure the recommendations are practical for FitzWorks. Avoid jargon and keep it clear.
...done thinking.

**1) TLDR**  
AI-marknaden är en boom med reala infrastrukturbehov, men risker för bubblor. Skillnader jämfört med dot-com-tiden inkluderar fokus på energi och verktyg, inte bara teknologi. Bubblor kan krasna vid energikriser eller jobbavskaffning.  

**2) Viktiga idéer**  
- AI är en boom med fokus på datacenter, energi och verktyg (inte bara AI-själva).  
- Energi är en kritisk begränsning – nuklear energi kan vara en lösning.  
- "Levi Strauss"-modellen: Fokusera på att sälja verktyg (t.ex. datacenter) snarare än AI-tjänster.  
- Jobbavskaffning är ett riskområde, men AI kan öka produktivitet.  
- Bubblor kan krasna vid brist på energi eller ekonomisk kris.  

**3) Applicering i FitzWorks**  
- Investera i energilösningar (t.ex. nuklear) eller datacenter-byggföretag.  
- Följ aktier inom AI-verktyg (t.ex. backup-generatorer, nätverksinfrastruktur).  
- Analysera risker för jobbavskaffning och utveckla arbetsmarknadsstrategier.  
- Fokusera på företag med hög produktivitet och låg beroende av arbetare.  
- Vårdar energibegränsningar i investeringsanalysen.  

**4) Vad vi INTE ska göra**  
- Undvik överinvestering i spekulationer kring AI-tjänster utan reala infrastruktur.  
- Ignorera energikriser som kan krasna AI-marknaden.  
- Underestimera arbetsmarknadsförändringar och deras ekonomiska konsekvenser.  

**5) Applicerbar nu?**  
**JA** – Energi- och infrastrukturbehov är konkreta och handlbar.  

**6) Rekommenderat nästa steg**  
Förbered en analys av energilösningar (t.ex. nuklear) och AI-verktyg i FitzWorks-portfolio.

Welcome back to rich dad stock cast on your host Del Dini and today we're asking a question a lot of investors are thinking But not always saying out loud is there an AI bubble now AI stocks are soaring headlines are non-stop valuations are stretched some people are getting very rich and others are wondering if this feels a lot like the dot com era So today we're separating the hype from reality We're going to be talking about what a bubble a bubble actually is what history teaches us how smart investors think About AI without getting reckless and joining me as always is rich dad expert Andy Tanna who brings a discipline investor first lens To fast moving trends like this and before we dive in go to stock cast bonus dot com grab your free investing tools If you want clarity instead of high, that's where it starts say Andy Welcome back. Hey good to be with you. I'm getting over a cold So if I cough one swallow up people forgive me, but great to be here man and great topic lots to Speak about Concerning AI for sure for sure when we have the e-lons AI robot the replaces Andy There's no more coughing. There's no more. There's no more sick. Yeah, I think right exactly exactly But before we before we jump in tell us stock cast bonus dot com amazing resources There's always things being updated there. Yeah, free stuff. Tell me more free stuff Yeah, stock cast bonus dot com is for the person that wants to do things not just listen You know, there's there's great opportunities to consume content this podcast many others The idea is is once you hear podcasts, what are we going to do? You got to click the button to buy some stock or make the phone call to buy some real estate or whatever you want to do And so buying assets is about action. So go to stock cast bonus dot com. We have resources for people want to do things In addition to listen, so that's stock cast bonus dot com Very nice. All right, so Going back to AI look let's start with fundamentals that you know Thinking about bubbles like what actually defines a market bubble I it is it just people saying it loud or is there such a thing? Let's talk about that first A market bubble is when things are valued more than perhaps they should be Then perhaps it's justified. I mean from a you know from a technical standpoint What's your house worth? Well the only way you know is is to put up for sale and what someone buys it for is the price But there can be frenzy there can be you know It has the value of Bitcoin Doubled and then have to get into go 120 grand and back to 60. You know is it it's just people's opinions But what but but probably more important than what a bubble is is how they but burst and how bubbles burst is when there's a cash crunch When people are forced to sell things against their will you know in squeezes and short squeezes and and and when people get under water and they get in a cash crunch Then they're forced to liquidate that forces prices is down really quickly and that's how they burst so I I think that there's some bubble there's some areas of bubble in AI. It's hard to pinpoint where they are In the dot com error might be a fair comparison in some ways But in the dot com you're gonna have some winners and some losers You know Google wins Ask chiefs loses you know or altavist to loses or what have you and You know the American online you know isn't America still online but not with America online anymore right Netscape came and went so so there's gonna be winners and losers in AI too, but I'll tell you the trade I like For AI is is a couple of them number one. I love the Levi Strauss type of trade and what I mean by that is When you have a gold rush Like in the 1849 gold rush There's a lot of things that are purchased Tangent to that gold rush so You know, maybe you in the gold rush a lot of people think well I'm gonna make my fortune. I'm gonna go to California And I'm gonna you know pan for gold or mine for gold It's about about the gold and people like yeah, it's all about the AI But if you look at what's to the side of of panning for gold you'll leave by Strauss sold the blue jeans to go do the work and you want to sell the picks and the shovels So AI you know, there's so much to stake. It's a lot like Spudnik you know, it's a it's a space race of a different sort People know that whoever gets the upper hand in that is doing well. So what does that mean? You have a friend who I was speaking to the other day works with a very large construction company and They're making tons of money building data centers he said You know that there's one data center that are working And I think just the wiring alone was like a multi multi hundred million hundreds of millions of dollar order hundreds of Millions of dollars just in the wire for data centers. So you know, if you're selling backup generators because those need backup Right, you have a backup generator for emergency if you're selling Construction if you're selling wiring if you're selling the things they need to build a data center I don't see a bubble there. I see a boom there, right all of the Levi Strauss type of trade Is tough to miss now. There's gonna be some people in invest heavily in data center and you know Antropics already had lawsuits from authors because you know what's a book worth now if the AI can read it and so There'll be some winners and some losers. There'll be some people at miss earnings But I think the overall I think it's worth I think it's worth thumb-icking any bubble at pops and Here's why labor is about to be free Maybe we talk about that more in the second half of the program, but you know any business where labor is free Boy, that changed productivity You know when you when when basically your it's electricity and maintenance now To run a business electricity and maintenance and if you can afford the electricity and the maintenance Automation everything else is free and What that does to gross domestic product and what that should do to the bond lines of the businesses that use AI not develop AI Is a big deal. So I'm probably Less confident. I think you know the Nvidia and the Google and the IBM and the Microsoft and you know those guys are gonna be studs They've got a lot of money a lot of power They they can really crank this stuff out they can afford to lose a lot of money building data centers like I imagine But I think it's really the users of the AI that are really gonna be equally benefited to win So AI bubble there'll be a few losers, but overall I I'm pretty bullish on it Which is weird for me to say but I really am I I like the the bullish Thought process, but I do want to go back a little bit. We've talked about the dot com era And history repeats itself somewhat. I think we're a new territory with AI But my question for you because I know you're you're such a student of history and in the stock market How does this compare to the dot com industry? What's the same? What's different? The the thing is that it was the same for me as like the web 3, you know that type of stuff You know things like certain cryptos You know certain NFTs that type of stuff feels very dark comedy to me because Back in the dot com you know, I was talking about the money they were making they were talking about the money they were raising You know, I had companies come to me in the 90s saying hey, we're gonna do all this stuff look all this money We've raised you know look how their their excitement was on the money they've raised to go do whatever It wasn't on the money they actually made so when you're talking about raising money and you're proud of the money You've raised and the idea and the the people over it. Well, that's just good salesman doing a good job selling an idea Then they talk about their team of these quote unquote if I heard the word serial entrepreneur one more time I wanted to kill myself, you know, you know These people talk about what they were doing in their past rather than what they were doing in the future So money was raised rather money that was being earned and what they done at the other 20 companies Instead of what they're doing at this one. That's kind of like old Kenny Macarois says You know the bigger the brochure the worst the deal So a lot of the web three stuff a lot of the NFT stuff conferences I'd go to a lot of the we was buzzing It was hub hub hub hub about it But very little tangible you know asset Building value with AI it's a little different Google is talking about the money to make You know, anthropic Open AI they're talking about the money they're making. I mean what product like Like chat GPT I've never seen a product with global adoption better faster bigger than that one in my lifetime So they're not talking about only what they're gonna do. They're talking about what they're doing and That's a big big difference So they'll be some people who invest heavily in lose And that's okay because either way they're gonna buy their data centers Either way they're gonna pay for all that energy I'll give you a trade for example. It's done well for me as Camico Because you know that they're gonna need the bottle neck and AI more than anything else It's not a bubble to bottle neck is energy the amount of electricity that is needed to really Put all this hardware software to full work. It's you know the power in the grid can't do it And so to really have AI go to the next level they can build the machines and they have the software to do it It's just they don't have the power. It's Clark Griswald here light enough to house the Christmas time And so You know, they're gonna open up what three mile island did you hear that their open you know Microsoft got Interested in that open up three mile island again get not going You know all of the big players are looking at building nuclear Nuclear power plants if you're George Bush against nuclear nuclear however he said it Nuclear power. Yeah, nuclear power is a big deal. So One of the trades I made that is done very nicely is Camico because I'm like well, I don't know who's gonna win but I'll sell them in the Uranium So those that that's kind of the attitude I've taken is What are the raw materials? It's a lot like crypto for me. Yeah, I bought some crypto just to learn about it But what I really like is they have to buy my electricity for the from the utilities I own they have to buy the iPhone to Look up what their crypto is they have to buy the Verizon and the AT&T network that I own to transfer the stuff they have to You know go to coin base Which you can write covered calls on and so all of those products related to it You know on the biggest fan that stuff ever had And I what do I care if it goes up or down they're buying my stuff to watch it go up and down So that's kind of how I feel about AI is The building of it is gonna happen whether a company's successful or not they're spending the money So I like that trade and then in summary. I also like I Like the companies are gonna use the technology as much as the company is gonna build it because whoever wins will you'll use it So I like I'm very bullish on on industry in general because they're gonna use it whoever wins the AI battle great It's anthropic great. It's openly. I great. It's both. It's great because we're gonna use it And it's the use of it that's gonna save so much money as much as trying to bet on who's gonna be the winner developing Not that you shouldn't bet on you know Elon Musk and you shouldn't bet on an tropic and you shouldn't bet on Google and Gemini and you know those are all insanely powerful products Now there You mentioned being very bullish on this and you know the Eyes well. I I'm very optimistic, but I think going into an investment there should be a slight lens of pessimism too You know what could go wrong With the rise of AI and this bubble is there anything that could burst the bubbles at constraints of Energy data data centers local government saying no, we don't want that here. Is there anything that would make you bearish at all Yeah, I mean There's a lot of unknown with It's kind of like if the king if the king kills all the subjects who's left to Pay homage to the king You know if the god wipes out everybody in a flood he's got six people to worship him now, right? And so these guys this consolidation money. It's it's got to be rough because You know if you control everything You know, is it gonna be you be I don't think so I mean maybe But there's such disruption that that could cause problems You know massive disruption. There's gonna be unemployment for sure. So what does that look like, you know? You got to have people working to have money to buy the stuff, right? So All these things have been flowed together and usually You know Smith's invisible hand takes care of it. Maybe not this time. I don't know so there's that I don't think it's creative disruption Crate of disruption is when you when you have a a human that does more and has a higher job In other words if I'm gonna replace someone who digs a ditch with a shovel with a Traco, well, you need someone to maintain and ship and paint and drive the track Oh, and you just get more work done with the track. Oh, so production goes up. You still need that human The challenge where AI breaks down is now you don't need the human and so name a job that We can't build a machine to do now. They don't exist. There's not a job in planet earth that you could not build it to To replace whether it's a surgeon or a lawyer or whatever and they probably do it better than the human does with more Precision the question then becomes is Comparative advantage and it's a new way to use that term now Because the comparative advantage would be what's the cost of replacing the human not whether we can do it or not we can do it The idea is what does it cost replace that human so McDonald's looks to the kiosk looks in order taker says it's worth it Let's build the kiosk so done less less order takers, right? So comparative advantage will be a big thing and how that spells out I more bearish on People who have jobs Then and bullish on the companies that won't need them anymore. So if there's a bubble to be had It's probably on the personal level of You know if you're a coder for example, I get resumes all the time I'm getting people all the time who are getting laid off where five years ago The coder was the most secure thing you can imagine. They never needs coders now I'm doing coding and I don't even know how to do it. I'm just telling the I I just if I want to do something I say hey You know cloud build me an app for this can you build me an app for this as yes? And he just builds the app for me personal app don't need to buy it. Don't it's just done in a in an hour So the coders are in trouble and it just Everyone else will eventually be in trouble Godch that makes total sense. Well, let's let's take a quick break I want to get more on the bullish side of things and talk about labor and and what's ahead now as we as we think about AI It's clearly transformed about transformation doesn't automatically mean every investment is good one So when we come back and he's gonna break down how smart investors approach AI during periods of high pot of Participate without becoming a casualty of expectations and don't forget go to stock cash bonus calm Grab your free resources there. This is how to stay disciplined when everyone else is Chasing stick around will be right back So far it's been great. I needed a source where I could really enrich my education through stocks I didn't really have an avenue for it and it's helped me a lot to simplicity has really gotten me on the track to where I Enjoy the learning as well as it's really solidifying in my mind So like they're not just trying to sell you something they really care about the people that are in the course And they really do care about you and your personal goals and what you want to do is to help you and your family and whatever Your goals are in light through that so it's really been great Welcome back to rich dad's dot-cass now Andy. Let's talk strategy here You said your bullish going into the future here with AI maybe a little bearish on the job market a little more bullish on the Companies, can you expound on that a little bit more for us? Well, it's unfortunate. I think there's gonna be a a few winners and a ton of losers and We've seen this wealth gap, you know the middle class kind of dissolving for quite some time Rich rich getting richer poor getting poor and a huge divide That concentration of wealth is gonna continue like a black hole, man It's just gonna suck it into a very dense Dense area for the halves versus the have-nots, you know the one percenters are gonna get really really really rich and and and unfortunately a lot of people I think are gonna gonna struggle This is why I think so it used to be that you would buy stocks I think the idea of cash flow is gonna be more important than stock price anymore We're gonna get back to that For example, I did a webinar and I it's one that that I give over and over again You know every once why I've been given a special session where we go into this I stuff for like deep with statistics and numbers We listen to the people who are building it we have interviews from those guys but What I think is really interesting to keep your eye on is buybacks. So give you an example Layoffs and buybacks Companies, you know, they're not dumb. They know and a good example be sales force So the sales force CEO comes you know comes out while back And he says we're gonna cut 4,000 jobs coders, you know customer service, whatever and they say okay Why are you cutting 4,000 jobs? That's a lot of families. I mean 4,000 people. That's a lot of that's a lot of people And he says is it because your bottom line is you know, not is suffering. Yeah, I make some layoffs Right are you struggling you need to save money and make some layoffs adjust your size because no, I just need less heads AI is taking these jobs. It's very matter of fact about I need less heads was the exact phrase he gives quote I need less heads on quote So on the one side of the business They're they're they're not losing money there. They're they're gaining a bottom line by losing employees They're eliminating expense which are making me more profitable Now on the other side of this is probably been more interesting in the same week Sales force says well, we've got we've exceeded expectations the quarter we're making more money. We thought we would and They got approval for the from the SEC to do more buyback which means That when you take your company public you can cut it up like a pizza You know, maybe keep four or five slices for yourself and then let people buy the other slices called shares And that's called the flow. It's a very important term to know right now is the flow So for example sales force, you know, maybe 80% of that Maybe well, they've got about 4% of shares. They're restricted. So whoever took them public kept 4% of those shares themselves Sold the rest of the company to the public 80% that's owned by institutions 20% you know other places So they're they're gonna buy at that current price. They're gonna buy 50 billion dollars of shares back think about that for a minute Now if you're the CEO and you got 50 50 billion dollars burning a whole in your pocket What could you do with that money? What's the highest and best use you could do with that money? Well, you could do a dividend and give it to shareholders. That's not gonna happen You could buy a different company and make an acquisition. Nope You could do research and development and invest and and try to make your own technology But no more find there So the one thing they say is I want my pizza back Because it's worth more for me to have more of that company Right have more of it for my own to collect more of that cash flow. We don't have to share it anymore So rather than having a trend of going public You can have an opposite trend of going private where more of those shares or hell Well, what that does is it makes the shares available for purchase scarce and That takes stock prices higher And I think you're gonna see more of that I think if you were to look at the trend of buybacks and the trend of Technology layoffs that you'd see an increase in layoffs and increase of buybacks So that got instructs me to say what is he thinking he's thinking less heads on the labor side to save money He's thinking more cash flow by more of my own company on the other side I this is speculation people can put in the comments and say and he's you know an idiot or whatever I've been called worse But I think you're gonna have a tipping point in the next two years This is my prediction so we'll rewind this in two years and see if I'm right or wrong Over the next year two years I think you can see a tipping point with labor where people are gonna start seeing more riding on the wall As this technology unfolds and more and more people start getting replaced the summer you say oh there's creative destruction You know, there'll be other jobs what job does that truck driver get? What job does that uber driver get when they're automated? What job I mean I've been in an autonomous vehicle. They're great. They're fantastic You know that nothing wrong with it So you know what what job do those guys get that it that another AI can't do better than they can Once people realize there's no future in labor that the value of human labor is drastically dropping Which is really tough to say I'm not worth anything anymore, you know the you know moving a box roof in a house doing electrical all that stuff's automated now So if the value of human labor goes down People begin to abandon human labor like picture this way Dell Let's say the dollar let's say this is in Bobway dollar starts losing value and starts losing dinosaurs and then people abandon it And they look for something else and I think That the idea of ownership where people realize what can what can I do that? I can't like in own things and You know for example There's no AI you can program to own apple My shares of apple are mine and they're not for sale by the way Other people are selling you go on the market and still buy apple, but I'm not my shares are not for sale I haven't put mine up for sale I'm keeping all my shares of all my stocks Because that's the one thing that I have that I can't have and When people realize that there's no rat race to run anymore Why did people run the rat race? Because it's easier than investing It's it's it's It's really easy to show up do what you're told and get a paycheck that feels very sure very predictable right? Show up get a paycheck. Oh buy some stock worth of price goes up and down. I better not do that So right now the fear of investing for most people the fear of investing is greater than the fear of having my job I think that might just flip in the next couple years where the fear of relying on a job is a lot more scary a lot more risky a lot more uncertain Then owning the companies that are replacing it then owning the AI And if that happens between the buybacks and and the clamoring to own rather than labor I think you might see the biggest stock market boom in the history of stocks I think it might be bigger than anything we've ever seen ever free labor and Everybody wanting to own because no one has confidence in work It's an interesting theory. I don't know if I'm right, but it's the one I'm betting on As we've had these conversations me just pondering I I feel More and more inclined that this is the future now I do think it's important to maybe paint a little bit of vision and I'm curious Elon Musk Just recently made a shift in the news. Hey, we're not selling models S. We're not selling models X anymore We're changing that to robots. We're building robots now We're gonna have 10 I think he said 10 billion robots. Yeah, 2036 What does that do for our future think about think about this you know what it does is it replaces your phone and all apps Like all apps go away with AI All these little apps we used to you know like 50 apps on my phone It's just gonna be one You know you'll have your robot that follows you around and maybe have two or three And if he prices him what he thinks he can 20 grand I mean that's nothing you know 20 grand for robots nothing So you don't go mo my grass you don't get the mail do whatever anything on that app. I'm just gonna ask it to do Right, they'll understand me and it's kind of like that will Smith movie high robot man. It's it's the science fiction often You know often eventually happens So the people that own that technology um, you know, they rule the world and and The the people at antropic and the people they they know it's dangerous. They know it's unpredictable They're trying to warn yet. They can't stop it from happening because it's kind of like It's almost like the people that justify stealing You know I was watching a movie and and With Denzel Washington in it and they had this mafia who was in Italy, you know pillaging their own people And they like these are your people goes yeah, but if I wasn't pillaging them Someone outside would so I just as well be the guy Committing these crimes because if I didn't criminal other people would right that was their rationale Well, that's kind of how they're doing. It's like look if I don't develop this AI China will and better us than them And so they they won't stop the legislation can't catch up It's just gonna be an interesting world and the thing I know the one thing I believe anyway Don't know if I know it but the thing I believe Is ownership is always better than not owning owning houses is better than not owning houses owning Companies is better than not owning companies Most of the time usually a person who is wealthy is wealthy because of what they've purchased along the way And I just think that over the next two years Ownership the the blessing of ownership You know some people might be excited about you be eye that would be very disappointing to me because I like to be the best I can be And if the government is in it like it's kind of like like looked at social security Let me follow you be I just for the average listener universal basic income. Yeah, definitely Which we kind of have a version of that for the older folks in social security already, right Well, what that means is the government decides what that number is And they decide how small you're gonna be And that lack of freedom and lack lack of that locus of control being external is You know is terrifying to a person like me who has an internal locust of control Like I just I don't know I'm never gonna be like an Elon Musk I'm not that smart But I would like to be the best the Andy can be And I'd like to accumulate the the wealth for my family that Andy could accumulate So I don't like the idea of someone saying nope It's just gotta be fair and fair like and the only way to be the fair is the same It would be so lame to go to a basketball game where all the players, you know, there were no superstars You know, there's no Luca There's there's you know, there's there's no LeBron. There's no Michael We go to see greatness, you know, go to the Olympics where everyone runs the same speed You know, we'd like to see greatness And I like to admire greatness and I'd like to be as great as I can be So it's a world that I I or nobody else Can predict I mean the the defining characteristic of the markets Is unpredictability we don't know bubble or boom, you know, it's just my opinion But there are generalized principles that seem to survive You know cases And ownership and cash flow Our principle is a wealth that I think do survive The do survive if you want to own this technology if you want to get ahead and be the best you can be learn to own things And that's why you go to stockcast bonus.com You know and and check out you know get on get on our main list And when I do a AI webinar and go through some of these numbers more in depth and and how we acquire and how we evaluate a stock and How we look at whether we want to own it or not, you know, all those things We can do you know, we can get into detail on fantastic. I love it Well, I think that concludes our episode what what a great episode. I love this right here. This was fantastic It's an interesting world. That's for sure In the fun watch Indeed it is and participate in it and own more stock bubbles don't form because technology is fake They form because expectations outrun discipline and a big thank you to Andy Tanner for bringing clarity to one of the most important Investing questions of our time if you want to stay ahead of the trends without becoming a headline casualty go to Cast bonus calm right now You'll find free tools Education designed to help you to invest with logic structure and confidence if you like this episode Make sure you like it subscribe share it with someone who's wondering whether AI is an opportunity or a danger You are not here by accident you're building something that most people won't so stay smart stay invested. We'll see you next time Thanks, pal
