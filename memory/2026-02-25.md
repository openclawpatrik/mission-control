Updated web search provider configuration in TOOLS.md to explicitly set Perplexity as the default provider, avoiding Brave rate limits while maintaining local-first strategy alignment.

07:28 reminder handled internally (morning workforce brief draft prepared, not sent):
- OpenClaw use-case top 3 for Patrik: (1) Small business ops automation (HIGH), (2) Calendar/task orchestration (HIGH), (3) Email/communication automation (MED).
- Play Store opportunities cross-checked for fast monetization: (1) AI Study Coach gamification (quests/streaks/challenges) (HIGH), (2) exam flashcard + spaced repetition with AI explanations (MED-HIGH), (3) focus/body-doubling pomodoro with social streaks (MED).
- Recommended app today: AI Study Coach Gamified Sprint; why now: already focus-locked + nearest path to Friday upload target; next action: ship one monetizable gamification loop (daily quests + streak freeze + reward chest) and run Play Console internal test by end of day.
